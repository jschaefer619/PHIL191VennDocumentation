# Introduction & The Approach

Diagrams have the power to communicate information in a visually salient manner.

This project explores the communication of logical relationships, specifically syllogisms, through Venn Diagrams. Loosely, syllogisms are a form of deductive reasoning to arrive at a conclusion based on two or more propositions that are assumed to be true.

An Example   
P1: All humans are mortal    
P2: All philosophers are humans.    

Conclusion: All philosophers are mortal.

Philosopher Sun-Joo Shin, among others, studied and systemetized the use of Venn Diagrams to visually communicate this form of logical reasoning. Here is a diagram demonstrating how the Venn System displays four types of relationships between two sets:






The goal of this project is to great an interactive system that can generate Venn Diagrams from logical sentences. It was motivated by:

Pedagogy - Digital tools provide new affordances for interactive learning. I hope others will utlize and enjoy this tool!

Personal Development - Programming is an exciting way to engage with this material. I would learn new skills along the way.

Thoughts on the systematicity of Venn - Implementing the Venn System computationally serves as a proof of concept. If a rule-based program can create the diagrams, this speaks to the systematicity of the Venn system. On first encounter, Iconic representations seem 'more slippery' compared to symbolic representations. This would challenge that notion.


## Execution

Initially, my impulse was to find a ready-made graphics package with Venn representations. Searches in open-source repositories seemed fruitful. However, many of these packages were designed to handle large volumes of data to represent. This was impressive in many ways - scaling the venn circles to fit ratios between data points was no small task. But ultimately, these packages were too complex and not flexible enough for my purposes.

I spent some time deliberating which programming language to use. Python was highly readable and a favorite of mine, but javascript would seamlessly travel to web. Though I did not have extensive Javascript experience, accessibility was a priority here. Javascript it was. I settled on utilizing the vector.js library to generate the graphics. Though vector.js did not have a large following, it's documentation was readable and importantly, filled with examples of implementation.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jschaefer619/PHIL191VennDocumentation/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
